# Olympic-data-analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical Olympic data to uncover meaningful trends and insights. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore athlete performances, country participation, and medal distributions using clean and visualized data. The dashboard was developed using Python and libraries like Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features
